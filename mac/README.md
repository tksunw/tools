This file has dumb script for MAC OS X.

I can't really see anyone needing any of these, because most of them are designed to be used with a headless MAC, where GUI management tools may not always be available.

Script: update-macos-vnc-passwd.sh
Purpose: this allows you to change the VNC password on a Mac when you forget it.
